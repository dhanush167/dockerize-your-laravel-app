# Dockerize your laravel app

## Usage


- **nginx** - `:8080`
- **mysql** - `:3306`

Three additional containers are included that handle Composer, NPM, and Artisan commands *without* having to have these platforms installed on your local computer. Use the following command examples from your project root, modifying them to fit your particular use case.

- `docker-compose run --rm composer update`
- `docker-compose run --rm npm run dev`
- `docker-compose run --rm artisan migrate` 


```
volumes:
  - ./mysql:/var/lib/mysql
```
